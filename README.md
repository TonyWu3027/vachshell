# VacShell

An on-blockchain solution for vaccine management system. 

## Progress

This is a mock-up of the system. The smart contract is deployed on **Ropsten** testnet and the Raspberry Pi is interacting with the contract. The frontend is a mock-up of the concept as it was not possible to link it with the smart contract within the time available for the hackathon.

## Components

- A smart contract deployed on **Ropsten** testnet: `./contracts/`
- A react dashboard mock-up created with `material-ui` template: `./frontend/`
- A Raspberry Pi 4B running Python scripts for scanning QR codes and interacting with the smart contract
